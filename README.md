# MNIST Neural Network (PyTorch)

Just a simple AF fully connected neural network trained on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch 

## 🧠 The Pertinents

- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST handwritten digits dataset
- Defines and trains a basic feedforward neural network
- Saves and loads model weights
- Evaluates performance on test data

## 🧪 Accuracy
Achieved **~89.5%** accuracy on the MNIST test set using GPU training

## 🛠️ Stack
- Python 3.10
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook (for experimenting and "Quantum-fying")
- VS Code
- Git + GitHub

## 📁 Files
- `mnist_nn.py`: Main training and inference code
- `mnist_simple_nn.pth`: Trained model weights
- `notebooks/`: Optional Jupyter versions of the project (Gonna be messy - will be using this for Quantum ML experimenting)

## 🚀 Run this project

From the terminal:

```bash
python mnist_nn.py
